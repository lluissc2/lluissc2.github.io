        <p> Attending the "Applied Business Tools" program at the University of Navarra last year has greatly enhanced my 
            digital skills profile. This course was based on amplifying my knowledge of Excel, a vital asset for any company 
            today. Through this course, I have acquired adaptability in the use of Excel for tasks ranging from data analysis 
            to financial accounting. This proficiency not only expands my effectiveness in handling digital tools, but also 
            underscores my preparation for the professional future that lies ahead.

        <p> Having the opportunity to access Harvard University courses on Innovation and Creativity, as well as Innovation 
            and Implementation through the University of Navarra, has been an enriching experience. <br>

            Learning the course on Innovation and Creativity allowed me to better appreciate the creative process and the means 
            to foster innovation. It has provided me with new ways to generate ideas and also instructed me on how to harness 
            the potential of creativity in solving challenges. <br>
            
            It has helped me learn techniques to overcome application barriers and also how to effectively manage innovation 
            projects. The courses have provided me with useful information and knowledge to use in the day to day life of any 
            entrepreneur. <br>

        <p> Collaborating on the team's Google Sites has been a task that we have had to insist on a lot, but in the end it 
            has been satisfactory. Not only because we have been able to coordinate among all of us to distribute tasks but 
            also to find solutions to the various conflicts that have arisen within the team. Ai, Glovo, artificial 
            intelligence, the elaboration of the pitch for the "Rooster Battle" and the interview I did with Xavier Verdaguer 
            have made us see the importance of knowing how to innovate and be different from the others. No one stands out 
            doing what others do, you have to reinvent yourself and "risk" in a certain way. After this experience, I would 
            advise people working with new people to emphasize communication. This skill is important to gradually progress 
            through the project and not hit any roadblocks. Communication helps to solve problems immediately and prevents 
            any additional ones from occurring.
